# College Mobility Analysis Dashboard Overview

## Navigation Structure
1. **Home**
2. **Mobility Ladder**
3. **Mobility vs Affordability**
4. **Institution Explorer**
5. **Enrollment Explorer**
6. **Mobility Work**

## Key Features

### 1. Mobility Analysis
- Shows how students move between income quintiles
- Tracks movement from bottom quintile to higher quintiles
- Visualizes mobility patterns using:
  * Sankey diagrams
  * Alluvial plots
  * Area charts

### 2. Affordability Analysis
- Compares mobility rates with college costs
- Quadrant analysis:
  * High Mobility / High Cost
  * High Mobility / Low Cost
  * Low Mobility / High Cost
  * Low Mobility / Low Cost
- Institution-specific cost breakdowns

### 3. Institution Explorer
- Detailed profiles of individual institutions
- Parent income distribution visualization
- Mobility rates across different quintiles
- Interactive selection by:
  * State
  * Institution type

### 4. Enrollment Explorer
- Shows enrollment patterns by institution type
- Visualizes distribution across income quintiles
- Includes top percentiles (1% and 0.1%)
- Shows cumulative percentages

### 5. Mobility Work Analysis
- Quantifies institutional "work done" in promoting mobility
- Considers three main factors:
  * Success rates in moving students up
  * Starting disadvantage (% of bottom quintile students)
  * Extra weight for serving more disadvantaged students
- Allows comparison between institution types

## Data Sources
- Uses Opportunity Insights dataset
- Combines:
  * Mobility data (table2)
  * Cost data (table10)
- Focuses primarily on four-year institutions

## Key Innovations
1. Introduces "work done" concept to evaluate institutional effort
2. Provides comparative analysis tools
3. Visualizes data through multiple perspectives
4. Allows detailed institutional comparisons

## Purpose
The dashboard is designed to help researchers, administrators, and policymakers understand how different institutions contribute to economic mobility, with particular attention to both outcomes and the effort required to achieve those outcomes.
